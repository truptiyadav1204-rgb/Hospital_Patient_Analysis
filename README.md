Hospital Patient Data Analysis
 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing hospital patient data using Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
The objective is to gain insights into patient demographics, disease trends, billing patterns, departmental performance, and patient satisfaction.

 Objectives

Understand patient admission trends

Analyze disease-wise patient count and revenue

Study demographic distribution (age and gender)

Evaluate department performance

Identify high-value patients

Visualize insights for better decision-making

 Tools & Technologies Used

Python

NumPy – Numerical calculations

Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib – Data visualization

Seaborn – Advanced visualizations

Excel / CSV – Dataset format

 Dataset Description

The dataset contains hospital patient records with the following columns:

Column Name	Description
Patient_Name	Name of the patient
Age	Patient age
Gender	Male / Female
Disease	Diagnosed disease
Department	Hospital department
Admission_Date	Date of admission
Bill_Amount	Total bill amount
Rating	Patient satisfaction rating
 Project Steps
Step 1: Import Libraries

Required Python libraries are imported for data analysis and visualization.

Step 2: Load Dataset

The hospital patient dataset is loaded using Pandas.

Step 3: Data Understanding

Basic information, data types, and summary statistics are examined.

Step 4: Data Cleaning

Missing values are checked

Duplicate records are removed

Admission_Date is converted to datetime format

Step 5: Feature Engineering

A new Month column is created from the admission date for monthly trend analysis.

Step 6: Numerical Analysis

Average, maximum, and minimum bill amounts are calculated using NumPy.

Step 7: Disease-wise Analysis

Patient count per disease

Total revenue generated by each disease

Step 8: Data Visualization

Disease-wise patient count (Bar Chart)

Monthly patient admission trend (Line Chart)

Revenue by disease (Bar Chart)

Step 9: Gender-wise Analysis

Patient distribution by gender using a pie chart.

Step 10: Age Group Analysis

Patients are grouped into age categories:

Child

Young Adult

Adult

Senior

Step 11: Department-wise Analysis

Patient count and revenue per department.

Step 12: Patient Satisfaction Analysis

Average patient rating by department.

Step 13: High-Value Patient Identification

Patients with bill amounts above the average are identified.

 Key Insights

Certain diseases contribute significantly to hospital revenue.

Monthly admission trends help identify peak periods.

Specific departments perform better in terms of revenue and patient satisfaction.

High-value patients can be targeted for personalized care.

 Conclusion

This hospital patient analysis provides meaningful insights into patient behavior, disease patterns, revenue distribution, and service quality.
The analysis supports better hospital planning, resource allocation, and data-driven decision-making.
